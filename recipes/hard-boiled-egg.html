    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hard-boiled egg is a cooked egg where both the white and yolk are fully set, typically achieved by boiling the egg in water for about 9-12 minutes. The shell is then removed to reveal a firm, pale white egg white and a solid, golden yellow yolk. This simple, nutritious food is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular snack or addition to salads, sandwiches, and various dishes. Hard-boiled eggs can be prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator for convenience, offering a quick and satisfying option for any meal.</p>
